🌟 Multiplication Table Learning Page
🔢 An Interactive Learning Project Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

📍 Live Demo: https://abhaysen07.github.io/Multiplication-Table/

👨‍💻 Author: Abhishek Kumar (Owner & Developer)

📌 Overview

The Multiplication Table Learning Page is an educational project designed to teach absolute beginners how multiplication tables work and how to generate them using JavaScript.

This project covers:

How to read inputs

How loops work

How logic flows step by step

How output is formed

Why these patterns are used in real coding interviews

It includes fully documented JavaScript, a logic flowchart, and clean visual structure — making it perfect for students and interview preparation.

🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ User Inputs

Base Number (like 5)

Start Number (like 1)

End Number (like 10)

2️⃣ JavaScript Code Processes It
for (let i = startNumber; i <= endNumber; i++) {
    let result = number * i;
    table += `${number} x ${i} = ${result}\n`;
}

3️⃣ Output is Displayed

Inside:

<pre id="tableOutput"></pre>

📘 Code Logic Summary

Each multiplication line follows:

number × i = result


Example:

5 × 3 = 15


The loop repeats this pattern to build the entire table.

🔍 Why This Project Helps in Interviews

Companies check if you understand:

Logical thinking

Loop control

Input → Processing → Output flow

Clean code

This is the type of logic-round question asked in:

Microsoft

Adobe

Infosys

TCS

Startups

Service-based companies

Support engineer technical screenings

💻 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Basic responsive design

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Core logic

GitHub Pages – Deployment

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure basics.

🧩 How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/abhaysen07/Multiplication-Table.git


Open the folder
